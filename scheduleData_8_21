The customer is responsible for the any changes required in the Operating systems on the Verint servers. The Verint application servers will have the server name, IP address and domain name updated in the Verint software. The WFM adapters will be updated for the system changes and functionality confirmed. The Verint SE will test and confirm functionality for the Verint applications including Advanced Speech and Data Analytics after the changes are made. The Wilmington QM – Recorder will be removed from the system configuration. The SE will confirm no errors are occurring for the Recorder after the change.
